# Brewery-Web-App
* Build a web application to search Brewery by City using Brewery APIs
  (https://www.openbrewerydb.org/documentation) and add reviews. This web app
  should have sign-up for new users and login for existing users.
* When a user logs in, the home page should have a Brewery search option. This
  search option should be able to search by_city, by_name, and by_type (Read
  API docs to see what by_city, by_name, and by_type means).
